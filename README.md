## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- CMake (optional, for larger projects)
- Git (for version control)


Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

    C++ Compiler: GCC or Clang (for Linux/Mac) or MSVC (for Windows).
    CMake: For building the project (optional if using Makefile).
    Git: For version control.
    Python: For running any scripts (if applicable).
    Bash: For running shell scripts (Linux/Mac) or Git Bash (Windows).

# Overview of Project Structure


    README.md: This file should provide an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage examples, and any other relevant information for users and developers.

    LICENSE: Ensure you have a clear license for your project to define how others can use it.

    Makefile: This file should contain the build instructions for your project, allowing users to compile the code easily.

    .env: Optional configuration file for environment variables, which is useful for managing sensitive information like API keys.

    bin/: Directory for compiled binaries. Make sure to include instructions in your README on how to run the compiled application.

    build/: Intermediate build files can be ignored in version control (consider adding to .gitignore).

    docs/: Documentation is crucial for understanding the architecture and usage of your application. Consider adding more detailed guides or API documentation.

    include/: Header files are well-organized. Ensure that each header file has appropriate comments and documentation for clarity.

    lib/: If you have external libraries, document their purpose and how to install them.

    scripts/: Useful for setup and testing. You might want to include a script for cleaning up build files or running tests.

    src/: The main source code is well-structured. Consider adding comments and documentation within the code to explain complex logic.

    cli/: The CLI interface is a good addition. Ensure that the commands are user-friendly and well-documented.

    test/: Unit and integration tests are essential for maintaining code quality. Consider using a testing framework like Google Test for better structure and reporting.

    data/: Sample datasets are useful for testing. Ensure that any real-world data is anonymized to protect privacy.

    config/: Configuration files should be well-documented to help users understand how to customize the application.
